===========================

The Contacts app for webOS Ports, built with Enyo2.

You can develop in the browser like a normal Enyo 2 app - Contacts
will use the data in db8SourceMock.js

When you're ready to install to a device, run `tools/deploy.sh -i`
(Luna-Next will restart)

TODO:
* sort contacts (current order => determined by db ;))
* allow contact editing
* db watches (currently => need to restart to get fresh data)
* contact image display is not working.
* favorites list not working
* fav star in details view not working, either
